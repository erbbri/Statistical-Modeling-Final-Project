# Statistical-Modeling-Final-Project
# This was my Final Project for my Statistical Modeling class Spring of 2021. The goal was to fit a linear model on a fuel dataset that would be used to predict MPG.

# The data includes information about 700 different models of cars and light trucks from 2018. There are 11 variables in the dataset: 
#  • MPG: the overall gas mileage for the vehicle (in miles per gallon)
#  • Weight: weight of the vehicle (in pounds)
#  • Cylinders: number of cylinders in the engine
#  • Gears: number of gears in the transmission
#  • Displacement: displacement of the engine (in liters)
#  • Horsepower
#  • AxleRatio: measure of drive shaft revolutions vs. axle revolutions
#  • NVratio: measure of engine speed versus vehicle speed at 50 mph
#  • Transmission; type of transmission, coded as “A” (automatic), “M” (manual), “SA” (semi-automatic), or “CVT” (continuously variable transmission)
#  • DriveSystem: coded as “F” (front wheel drive), “R” (rear wheel drive), “A” (all-wheel drive), or “4” (four-wheel drive)
#  • FuelType: “unleaded” or “diesel”

# The goal was to build a model to predict the gas mileage (MPG) of a car using any of the other variables in the dataset that you find useful. The data provided are a random sample from a larger set of data with information about additional vehicles. This model I built was tested on the rest of the data, and was the 2nd best at predicting the largest percentage of the variation in gas mileage in the class.
